This is an Unconventional Living planner.
Enter your income and age and this calculator will tell you how many years until you can be financially independent or
How much you would have to save for "mini retirements". That is, taking every 4th year off of work.
If no minimum budget is provided, the budget of $30,000 after tax will be used
The amount that can and should be contributed to a TFSA every year is calculated, a map of each year will be printed.
The amount that can and should be contributed to a RRSP every year is calculated, a map of each year will be printed.
The amount that can and should be contributed to a Savings every year is calculated, a map of each year will be printed.

Savings Methodology:
Under $70,000 income, always contribute to TFSA first
Above $70,000 income, contribute to RRSP first.
Something to consider is that this might only be true with a savings rate of 1/3rd of your income. With more or less
being saved it may differ.
This is based off of http://www.moneyaftergraduation.com/2015/01/05/should-you-contribute-to-an-rrsp-or-tfsa/
In the future this could be plugged into a TFSA vs RRSP calculator

TFSA:
counted into the annual income tax, no gains are taxed, no deduction when taking money out.
This should be contributed too when you think you will be making more money later in life. (double check this statement)

RRSP:
A max of 18% of your annual income can be added, the contribution is tax exempt when contributed but taxed when taken
out, unless a home is purchased with it (double check)
To look into, are their significant deductions if money is removed before a certain age or retirement?
$24270 is the max amount that can be contributed which it hit with an income of $130,000

Savings:
This is assumed to be fully taxed when you make it and annual interest is fully taxed as income

Mini Retirements:
Mini retirements are based around the idea of working for 3 years and taking the 4th year off. And repeating the cycle.
Things to keep in mind is pension deduction based on working less years.
Problems that cannot be accounted for is having a job that allows for this, or finding a new job every 4 years

Financial Independence:
Having enough money to not have to work again.
(SWR) safe withdrawal rate is 4%, with inflation taken into account.

Tax:
    Quebec(2017):
        Gross taxable income brackets	Marginal tax rates
            14 890$ or less	                0%
            14 890.01$ to 42 705$	        15%
            de 42 705,01$ to 85 405$	    20%
            de 85 405,01$ to 103 915$	    24%
            103 915,01$ or more	            25.75%

Pension Plans:
    Deductions for early retirement:
    Annual Contributions

Annual Numbers that Change:
-Federal and Provincial Income Tax
-EI deduction rates and max
-TFSA additional contribution space

Assumptions:
-No raise taken into account
-Average return on investments is 9.5% (This has been calculated elsewhere, find link) issue it leads to is say the first
5 years were - 11% and after that it was in the 20%s this affects the interest earned.
-inflation is calculated as 3% per year
-Assumes TFSA annual added contribution is $5500
-Taxed as Single
-Taxes remain the same annually
-Assumes money paid in tax is never overpaid, therefore not tax return
-Assumption that EI deduction stays the same for every year to come
-4% inflation annually

Known Errors:
-TFSA room eligibility could be off by one year due to your Birthday

Possible Errors:
-Is the initial amount in savings counted as being contributed every year?
